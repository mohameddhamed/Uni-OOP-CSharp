Implement type of priority queue. The items of the queue consist of two fields: < priority (integer),
data (string)>. From the queue, we always take out the element with the highest priority. If there are
more maximums, there is no restriction which to get first. 

Goals:
1. Implementing types in the operations of which algorithmic patterns are used,
2. Testing,
3. Exception handling.
